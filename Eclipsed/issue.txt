So what I get from this is that it properly changes door variant (code below)

but don't load ExtraSprite which is double locked chains sprite.
and it loads only when reentering room

what I wanted to do - is funiction similar to SetLocked() or Bar() from GridDoor class

```lua
for gridIndex = 1, room:GetGridSize() do -- get room size
    local grid = room:GetGridEntity(gridIndex)
    if grid and grid:ToDoor() then
        local door = grid:ToDoor()
        if door:GetVariant() == DoorVariant.DOOR_LOCKED then
            door:SetVariant(DoorVariant.DOOR_LOCKED_DOUBLE)
           	
            --door.ExtraSprite  -- do something with this
            --already checked Reset, Reload, LoadGraphics and etc. I can't make it work
        end
    end
end
```
